Pascal — DeFi researcher & writer

This is a simple static portfolio built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

How to view

- Open `index.html` in a browser. For local dev with a simple server, you can run the following in PowerShell from the project folder:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

Notes
- I replaced the original logo with `assets/pascal logo.jpg` from your assets folder. If you'd like a different image or an SVG logo, replace that file.
- Background decorative blobs are implemented in CSS and respond to pointer movement for a subtle parallax effect.

Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/script.js` — interactions
- `assets/` — logo and profile SVGs

Replace the placeholder links and text with your real content (Medium links, socials, email).
